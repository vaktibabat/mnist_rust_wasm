# mnist_rust_wasm
In [another project of mine](https://github.com/vaktibabat/rust-neural-nets) (accompannied by a [blogpost](https://vaktibabat.github.io/posts/Rust_WASM_Digit_Recognition_1/)), I trained a neural network
from scratch (i.e. no ML-related dependencies) on MNIST. In this project, we deploy said model using WASM and Rust in a WebApp that recognizes digits!
